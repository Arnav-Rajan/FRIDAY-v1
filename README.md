FRIDAY-v1

A personal assistant written in python inspired by Iron man
FRIDAY is a personal assistant made using Python. It is coded in a structured way so that you can easily 
understand and modify the code for your needs. I only tested Jarvis on windows, but it should run on other operating systems 
if the required modules are installed.
