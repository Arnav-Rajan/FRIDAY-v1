# FRIDAY V1

#### A personal assistant written in python inspired by Iron man

 FRIDAY is a personal assistant made using Python. It is coded in a structured way so that you can easily 
 understand and modify the code for your needs. I only tested FRIDAY on windows, but it should run on other operating systems 
 if the required modules are installed.
